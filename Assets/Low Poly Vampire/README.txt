Thanks for buying!With the package, you have access 3 different models: Vampire (Human Form), Vampire (Monster Form), and a Bat.Each model has its own animations ready for use.The models do not use textures, but rather materials, which makes it easier for the user to modify its colors.Each one has the following number of triangles (polygons):	-Human:3862	-Monster: 8274	-Bat: 4522Contact me for support or for suggestions of animations for this package, as I am willing to update it:	E-mail: gliptoart@gmail.com	Instagram: @gliptoartCredits:Models and animations by GliptoRigging based on that by Royal Skies (https://www.theroyalskies.com/royal-resources)
